A recent highlight was helping a friend access a website that loaded fine for me but errored out for him, pointing to an ISP-level DNS issue. 
Suspecting a block or misconfiguration, I first suggested switching to a public DNS like Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 via Windows Command Prompt.
When he struggled with CLI, I pivoted to a simpler tool: recommending the Cloudflare WARP app, which automates DNS changes, adds encryption, and bypasses restrictions.
Installation took minutes, and it fixed the problem instantly, restoring access.
This incident showcased quick thinking, ruling out browser caches or VPNs first and emphasized user-centric support: adapting instructions to skill levels.
It also highlighted DNS vulnerabilities, like ISP censorship, and how tools like WARP enhance privacy without complexity. 
The fix prevented ongoing frustration and educated him on basic networking, aligning with concepts like DNS resolution hierarchies.
