Exploring operating systems has been a key part of my self-learning. 
I recently migrated my laptop from Windows to Linux Mint, a process involving backing up data, creating a bootable USB via Rufus, partitioning the drive with GParted, and configuring GRUB for dual-boot.
This switch improved system stability and introduced me to open-source tools like apt for package management. 
Building on that, I set up a virtual environment using VirtualBox, provisioning three VMs: Windows 7 for legacy software testing, Windows XP to simulate outdated environments, and Kali Linux for penetration testing exercises from my cybersecurity studies.
I allocated resources (e.g., 4GB RAM per VM, virtual CPUs), networked them (bridged adapters for internet access), and installed tools like Metasploit in Kali. 
This setup allowed safe experimentation, such as testing malware in isolation.
