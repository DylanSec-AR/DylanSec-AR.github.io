For instance, when a friend wanted a gaming rig that could handle future upgrades without breaking the bank, I researched components like CPUs (e.g., AMD Ryzen series for cost-efficiency), GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX for ray tracing), RAM (ensuring DDR4/5 compatibility), and storage (NVMe SSDs for speed). I prioritized future-proofing by selecting modular PSUs and motherboards with extra PCIe slots. Once selected, I either assembled the PC myself—handling cable management, thermal paste application, and BIOS setup—or provided step-by-step remote guidance via video calls, troubleshooting issues like boot failures in real-time. This process not only ensured the builds met specific needs (e.g., video editing for another friend required high-core CPUs) but also taught me about compatibility pitfalls, such as mismatched RAM timings. Outcomes included fully functional systems that performed 20-30% better in benchmarks than off-the-shelf options, saving users up to $200 in costs.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Portfolio"/><category term="Hardware"/><category term="Assist"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[PC Build]]></summary></entry></feed>
